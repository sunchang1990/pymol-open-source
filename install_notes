1. Create a python 2.7 environment using conda.
2. Add all the required and missing packages with conda. Particularly, gcc
should be installed. A yml file of the final conda environment is included in
this folder.
3. python setup.py build install --osx-frameworks
This command first build the package under the "build" sub-directory, 
then copy the package into designated directory.
** --osx-frameworks is the key, otherwise, the pymol screen appears red.
